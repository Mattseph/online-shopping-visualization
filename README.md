The dataset consists of a comprehensive set of 22 columns, each representing a distinct attribute within the data. These columns cover a wide range of information, encompassing unique identifiers such as CustomerID and Transaction_ID, categorical variables like Gender and Product_Category, and numeric fields including Tenure_Months, Quantity, and Delivery_Charges. With a total of 52,925 rows, the dataset contains a substantial number of detailed records or observations across various attributes and instances. The dataset, with its configuration of 22 columns and more than 52,000 rows, forms a significant reservoir of data that facilitates comprehensive analysis and exploration of trends in online shopping, customer behaviors, and transaction patterns. This dataset's breadth and depth offer researchers and data analysts a robust foundation to extract valuable insights, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the online shopping landscape.

## Relevance to Project Goals
The online shopping dataset is highly relevant to our project, where we are expected to develop an app capable of loading, cleansing, visualizing data, and applying analytics techniques like descriptive and predictive analytics. This dataset serves as a valuable repository of information encompassing diverse aspects of customer interactions, product details, and transaction histories. The dataset is a foundational resource, populating our app's database with a significant amount of data points. The dataset introduces challenges such as missing values necessitating robust cleansing and preprocessing procedures. By addressing issues like missing values in the dataset, our project can ensure the delivery of accurate and reliable insights. The dataset's richness contributes significantly to the visualization component, enabling users to explore and analyze a broad spectrum of variables. Lastly, its comprehensive nature allows for the implementation of advanced analytics techniques, including both descriptive analytics to understand historical patterns and predictive analytics to anticipate future trends
